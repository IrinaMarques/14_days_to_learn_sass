Day 1: Syntax
==============

This language as two syntaxes
scss (new)
sass (older)

Diferences:

sass is an extension of css but we can do more:
- variables
- nesting 
- operations

sass:
- uses indentation instead {}
- instead of ; uses new lines

How you write comments:
/*css*/
Use multiline comment
//scss
//sass
Everything under is multiline comment
